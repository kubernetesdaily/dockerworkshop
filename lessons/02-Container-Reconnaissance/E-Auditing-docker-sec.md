## Auditing Docker Security

DOCKER BENCH FOR SECURITY

Docker Bench for Security is an open source Bash script that checks for various common security best practices of deploying Docker in production environments. The tests are all automated and are based on the CIS Docker Benchmark. More information about Docker Bench for Security can be found
on GitHub: https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security


## auditing docker security with docker bench for security 


The auditing process can be performed by following the procedures outlined below:

You first need to clone the docker/docker-bench-security GitHub repository on your Docker host. This can be done by running the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
```
After cloning the repository, you will need to navigate into the docker-bench-security repository that you just cloned:

```
cd docker-bench-security


```

The cloned directory will contain a Bash script named docker-bench-security.sh. We can run this script to perform the Docker security audit by running the following command:

```
sudo ./docker-bench-security.sh
```

When the script is executed, it will perform all the necessary security checks. Once completed, it will provide you with a baseline security score as highlighted 

```

# Docker Bench for Security Options 

```bash
   b           optional  Do not print colors
  -h           optional  Print this help message
  -l FILE      optional  Log output in FILE, inside container if run using docker
  -u USERS     optional  Comma delimited list of trusted docker user(s)
  -c CHECK     optional  Comma delimited list of specific check(s) id
  -e CHECK     optional  Comma delimited list of specific check(s) id to exclude
  -i INCLUDE   optional  Comma delimited list of patterns within a container or image name to check
  -x EXCLUDE   optional  Comma delimited list of patterns within a container or image name to exclude from check
  -n LIMIT     optional  In JSON output, when reporting lists of items (containers, images, etc.), limit the number of reported items to LIMIT. Default 0 (no limit).
  -p PRINT     optional  Disable the printing of remediation measures. Default: print remediation measures.

```

# Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user, if possible (Manual) 

The Docker containers by default run with the root privilege and so does the application that runs inside the container. This is another major concern from the security perspective because hackers can gain root access to the Docker host by hacking the application running inside the container.


Add user to Docker group

```bash
$ sudo groupadd docker
```
add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker [non-root user]

```

Using Dockerfile (USER instruction)

dit the Dockerfile that creates a non-root privilege user and modify the default root user to the newly-created non-root privilege user, as shown here:


```bash
##########################################
# Dockerfile to change from root to 
# non-root privilege
###########################################
# Base image is CentOS 7
FROM Centos:7
# Add a new user "sangam" with user id 8877
RUN useradd -u 8877 sangam
# Change to non-root privilege
USER sangam

```

Proceed to build the Docker image using the “docker build” subcommand, as depicted here:

```bash
sudo docker build -t nonrootimage .

```
 Finally, let’s verify the current user of our container using the id command in a docker run subcommand:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm nonrootimage id
```

```
If not required, you should restrict the network traffic between containers.

By default, unrestricted network traffic is enabled amongst all containers on the same host in the default network bridge. However, a bad actor positioned in a compromised container could leverage this functionality to abuse other services exposed by other containers within the container network on the same host.

To disable the inter-container communication, configure the daemon with the icc flag set to false. Note that this configuration can be overridden by containers that are run with the deprecated --link option.


```bash
$ docker network ls -q | xargs docker network inspect -f '{{ .Name }}: {{ .Options }}'
```
The com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc should be set to false for the default network bridge.

You should also consider using user-defined bridge networks to enforce network isolation among containers as a more flexible solution.

# Protect the UNIX socket from unintended access



The non-networked /var/run/docker.sock UNIX socket is used by default to locally access the Docker Engine API. The safe default settings on Linux include a socket file owned by the “root” user and a “docker” group allowing solely “root” read and write file permission (ug+rw).

Run this command to review the correctness of the Docker UNIX socket permissions.

```bash
$ ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  daemon  44  4 Jan 17:16 /var/run/docker.sock -> /Users/sangambiradar/.docker/run/docker.sock
```

# Use secure registries to pull and push images

nsecure registries do not use TLS, nor do they have an invalid TLS certificate. Such registries should not be used as they are prone to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by malicious actors who are able to modify the network traffic.

Run the below command to list the insecure registries used by the Docker daemon.

```bash

docker info --format '{{.RegistryConfig.InsecureRegistryCIDRs}}'

```

# Enable user namespace support 
```bash
ps aux | grep dockerd
sangambiradar    34266   0.0  0.0 408626880   1280 s000  S+    7:22PM   0:00.00 grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn --exclude-dir=.idea --exclude-dir=.tox dockerd
```

```bash
docker container run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh

```

To follow the principle of least privilege, containerized applications should not be run as root. To achieve this, then the --user parameter can be used to specify a user other than root for the container. It accepts as value a username (if it was previously created in the Dockerfile) or a UID, optionally a GID as well.

## Enable Content Trust
Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled. Content trust is a system for signing Docker images and verifying their signatures before running them. We can enable content trust with the `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` environment variable.

To set this variable for your current shell 
session, type the following into the shell:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

```


Running the audit after this export command should show that Content trust has been enabled and clear this warning. To enable it automatically for all users and all sessions, add the `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` variable to the `/etc/environment` file, which is a file for assigning system-wide environment variables:

```bash
echo "DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/environment

```

## Ensure auditing is configured for various Docker files

```bash
sudo apt-get install auditd
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/audit/audit.rules
ubuntu@enormous-longspur:~$ sudo cat  /etc/audit/audit.rules
## This file is automatically generated from /etc/audit/rules.d

-b 8192

Restart auditd for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

## Correcting Docker Daemon Configuration Warnings

```bash
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
ubuntu@docker:~/docker-bench-security$ cat nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
cat: nano: No such file or directory

    "no-new-privileges": true
}

sudo systemctl restart docker

```

##  Enable Content Trust

Content trust is a system for signing Docker images and verifying their signatures before running them. We can enable content trust with the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment variable.

```bash 
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

```

Running the audit after this export command should show that Content trust has been enabled and clear this warning. To enable it automatically for all users and all sessions, add the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST variable to the /etc/environment file, which is a file for assigning system-wide environment variables:

```
