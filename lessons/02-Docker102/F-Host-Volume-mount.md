title: " Host Volume Mount - Data persistentence "
description: " Build own image "
---

we already used database with web app but docker containers are ephermal. this means they are losing data once removed or re-started so somewhere need to find data persistent 

create `docker-compose.yml` using following content 

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: myphpapp-db
    environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somepass
       MYSQL_DATABASE: somedatabase
  dbclient:
    image: mysql:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: mysql -uroot -psomepass -hdb
```

MYSQL_DATABASE will create an empty database with the name "somedatabase" at first 

depends_on waits for the container to start on the other containers 


###  run the command 

```bash
