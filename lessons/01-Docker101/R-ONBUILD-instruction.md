#### The ONBUILD instruction

The ONBUILD instruction is a trigger. It sets instructions that will be executed when another image is built from the image being build.

This is useful for building images which will be used as a base to build other images.

```sh
ONBUILD COPY . /src

```

You can't chain ONBUILD instructions with ONBUILD.
ONBUILD can't be used to trigger FROM instructions.


```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.16-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
ONBUILD COPY index.html . 
```

#### build dockerfile

docker build -t sangam14/onbuild-dockerfile  -f dockerfile.onbuild .
